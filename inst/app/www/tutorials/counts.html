<p> The counts plot is straightforward : it displays genes counts. <p>
<p>You can choose the variable by which to group the samples, the levels of this variable, then of course which genes to plot. Finer settings are available, for instance the scale of the y-axis, the lower limit of this axis (minimum of the values or 0), and, if there are enough samples by level (5 minimum for each level), a boxplot representation is also available.</p>
<p> Appearance is also customizable, with notably input for shift x-axis labels around, as sometimes labels are too long.</p>
