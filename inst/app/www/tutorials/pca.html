<p>The PCA tab is pretty simple.</p>
<p>It is possible to change the theme of the plot, the colors of each condition, and whether each sample is labeled with its name.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to remove a sample, if you consider it is likely to be an outlier, to see how much it affects the plot. It could prevent the conditions from nicely aggregating. The incriminated sample is removed from the raw data, then the normalization and the regularizing transformation are recomputed. Finally, the principal component analysis is recomputed. However, it does not affect the rest of the analysis in the app, consequently, if you wish to remove a sample from the entire analysis, <a href="mailto:ngs.u1016@inserm.fr">contact us</a>.
As for all the other plots, three formats are available for download : pdf and svg which are vectorized (made of paths and objects), and png which is rasterized (made of pixels). Svg is particularly useful, as it allows lossless, element-wise modification in free software such as Inkscape (tutorial <a href="https://inkscape.org/learn/tutorials/">here</a>). It can in turn export to png.</p>
