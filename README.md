# Introduction

SHARE is a shiny application for the visualisation and analysis of pre-processed RNA-seq data. Given data processed with GENOM'IC's pipeline, it is able to produce customasible plots, such as PCA plots, Volcano plots and Heatmaps. It also allowes one to explore the counts and results table interactively.

SHARE is an exploration tool, it relies on data already processed from raw reads, following a STAR -> RSEM -> DESeq2 pipeline, with gene name annotation with Biomart.
