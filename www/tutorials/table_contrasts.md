### Contrasts
A specific table is tied to a specific contrast between conditions (is gene x differentially expressed in Condition A compared with Condition B?). When the current contrast is changed, then the whole table changes. The selected genes are not carried on, neither are they (currently) saved for a specific contrast (they are not reselected when one comes back to a previously studied contrast). If you are working to produce results on a specific set of genes, do not forget to save the current selection via the Selected Genes' IDs download! This can be uploaded later.

In the following video, contrast change is shown. You do not need to be on the Table tab to change the contrast though.
