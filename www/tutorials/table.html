<div><p>The interactive table is a central part of the application. It displays the statistical results of the DESeq2 analysis concerning the selected comparison.</p>
<h3>Selection</h3>
<p>There are many ways to interact with it, ordering by rows, and also selecting them. The selected rows are then displayed in the &quot;Selected genes&quot; tab, and one can download them, or only the Gene&#39;s IDs, for further analysis. The latter is also used to save a certain selection, to the upload them in another work session. This will be explained later on. This process of selection is shown in the first video.</p>

<p>The gene selection is useful outside of this particular tab : indeed, the current selection is carried on in the MA-plot, Volcano plot and Heatmap tab, labelling (by default, but it is possible to change it) the genes in the first two plots, or to be used as a custom row selection in the heatmap tab. This is shown in the second video.</p>

<h3>Contrasts</h3>
<p>A specific table is tied to a specific contrast between conditions (is gene x differentially expressed in Condition A compared with Condition B?). When the current contrast is changed, then the whole table changes. The selected genes are not carried on, neither are they (currently) saved for a specific contrast (they are not reselected when one comes back to a previously studied contrast). If you are working to produce results on a specific set of genes, do not forget to save the current selection via the Selected Genes&#39; IDs download! This can be uploaded later.</p>
<p>In the following video, contrast change is shown. You do not need to be on the Table tab to change the contrast though.</p>

<h3>Table searching</h3>
<p>You can search for your favorite genes in the search bar! Note that this search is not restricted to the Gene names column, it searches the whole table, the Genes IDs, the description... As shown in the following video, selection is saved even when clearing the search bar.</p>

<h3>Columns</h3>
<p>By default, only certain columns are shown : </p>
<ul>
<li>ENSEMBL Gene ID, </li>
<li>mean of normalized expression across all the samples, the \(log_{2}(FoldChange)\),</li>
<li>the <em>p-value</em> adjusted for multiple comparison with the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg method (no value indicates that either there was a count outlier, or that the gene was independently filtered out as it had a low chance of being significant, or that expression was null),</li>
<li>name of the gene</li>
<li>Description of the genes according to quoted sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>But other columns are hidden in the <strong>Column visibility</strong> dropdown, such as stats of the statistical analysis (standard error, Wald statistic, raw <em>p-value</em>), as well as normalized counts for each sample.
The following video displays those possibilities :</p>

<h3>Filtered Download</h3>
<p>Another possibility is to download the significant genes at selected filters. This allows you to perform other analysis, such as over-representation analysis (ORA), with gene names or IDs. It is shown in the following video.</p>

<h3>Upload</h3>
<p>You can save and recover a particular selection of genes through the <strong>Row selection</strong> box. In the <strong>Selected genes</strong> tab, there is a download genes IDs button, which downloads a file with the IDs of the genes selected, one by line. It is a plain text (<code>.txt</code>) file. You can then use it to restore a selection by uploading it in the <strong>Row selection</strong> box.
You can also select genes based on a list of genes names, stored in a similar plain text file (1 gene name by line). Inspect the selection afterwards, there may be more genes sharing a pattern than you think! The selection is not case-sensitive.</p>
