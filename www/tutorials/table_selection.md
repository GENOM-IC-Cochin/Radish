The interactive table is a central part of the application. It displays the statistical results of the DESeq2 analysis concerning the selected comparison.

### Selection
There are many ways to interact with it, ordering by rows, and also selecting them. The selected rows are then displayed in the "Selected genes" tab, and one can download them, or only the Gene's IDs, for further analysis. The latter is also used to save a certain selection, to the upload them in another work session. This will be explained later on. This process of selection is shown in the first video.

The gene selection is useful outside of this particular tab : indeed, the current selection is carried on in the MA-plot, Volcano plot and Heatmap tab, labelling (by default, but it is possible to change it) the genes in the first two plots, or to be used as a custom row selection in the heatmap tab. This is shown in the second video.
