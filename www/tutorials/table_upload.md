### Upload
You can save and recover a particular selection of genes through the **Row selection** box. In the **Selected genes** tab, there is a download genes IDs button, which downloads a file with the IDs of the genes selected, one by line. It is a plain text (`.txt`) file. You can then use it to restore a selection by uploading it in the **Row selection** box.
You can also select genes based on a list of genes names, stored in a similar plain text file (1 gene name by line). Inspect the selection afterwards, there may be more genes sharing a pattern than you think! The selection is not case-sensitive.
